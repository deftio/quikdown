# Claude Session Summary - QuikDown v1.0.3 Release & Optimizations

## Session Date: 2025-08-17

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Released v1.0.3 Successfully
- Fixed GitHub Actions release workflow (was using deprecated actions)
- Updated to use `softprops/action-gh-release@v1` with proper permissions
- Successfully published to npm and created GitHub release
- Final bundle size: **7.4KB minified** (24% reduction from 9.2KB)

### 2. CSS Theme System Improvements
- Implemented container-based theme scoping with parent-child selectors
- Both light and dark themes now have explicit colors for robustness
- Fixed dark theme issues on quikdown-live.html page
- Added auto dark mode support with `.quikdown-auto` class
- Theme files: `dist/quikdown.light.css` (3.2KB) and `dist/quikdown.dark.css` (4.3KB)

### 3. Fixed Critical Issues
- **Test Coverage**: Fixed Jest config to properly measure dist files (now 99.58%)
- **Build Warnings**: Eliminated all rollup sourcemap warnings
- **Dark Mode**: Fixed h1 headings being unreadable in dark mode with inline styles
- **Lexer Parity**: Updated quikdown-lex to have same emitStyles() theme support

### 4. Documentation Updates
- Updated release notes for v1.0.3
- Added ESM CDN examples (now shown before UMD in README)
- Updated API reference with emitStyles() theme parameter
- Updated TypeScript definitions with theme support

### 5. Branch Organization
- Main branch has v1.0.3 released
- optimize-size branch updated with v1.0.4dev1
- Todo items properly organized (completed moved to todo_completed.md)

## Key Technical Decisions

### CSS Architecture
- Chose container-based theming over inline styles for themes
- Parent-child selectors (`.quikdown-light .quikdown-h1`) prevent conflicts
- Both themes specify explicit colors to prevent inheritance issues
- Single source of truth: CSS generated from JavaScript emitStyles()

### Size Optimizations Completed
- Module-level constant hoisting (QUIKDOWN_STYLES, CLASS_PREFIX)
- Optimized placeholder strings (Â§CB vs %%%CODEBLOCK%%%)
- CSS string optimization (removed spaces after colons)
- Build-time version injection
- Eliminated duplicate getAttr functions

## Current State

### Package Versions
- Released: v1.0.3 (main branch)
- Development: v1.0.4dev1 (optimize-size branch)

### File Sizes
- Main bundle: 7.4KB minified
- Lexer bundle: 8.3KB minified
- Light theme CSS: 1.9KB minified
- Dark theme CSS: 2.6KB minified

### Test Coverage

- Functions: 100%
- Lines: 100%
- Branches: 92.3%
- Tests: 109 passing

## Next Steps (When Resuming)

### Critical for quikchat Integration
1. **Lazy linefeeds support** - Add option for single \n to become `<br>`
   - Many chat/LLM outputs don't use proper markdown line breaks
   - Add option like `lazy_breaks: true`

2. **Pure CDN example with plugins**
   - Create example with highlight.js and mermaid
   - Show best practices for fence plugins

### Nice to Have
- Error callback for graceful handling of malformed markdown
- CLI tool for testing markdown conversion
- Custom color palettes for emitStyles()

## Integration Notes for quikchat

### Ready to Use
- Small size (7.4KB) perfect for chat applications
- XSS protection built-in for user-generated content
- Fence plugin system for code highlighting
- TypeScript definitions included
- Theme system with light/dark modes

### Workaround for Lazy Linefeeds
```javascript
// Pre-process LLM output if needed
const markdown = llmOutput.replace(/(?<!\n)\n(?!\n)/g, '  \n');
const html = quikdown(markdown);
```

### CDN Integration
```html
<!-- ES Modules (recommended) -->
<script type="module">
  import quikdown from 'https://unpkg.com/quikdown@1.0.3/dist/quikdown.esm.min.js';
  
  // For dark mode support
  import 'https://unpkg.com/quikdown@1.0.3/dist/quikdown.dark.min.css';
</script>
```
