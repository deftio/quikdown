        // and both have predefined styles. We need to be creative.
        
        // One approach: Try to create a malformed table that somehow triggers this
        // But the processInlineMarkdown function creates its own getAttr...
        
        // Let's try a different approach - what if we could somehow get a table
        // cell to be processed with a non-standard tag?
        
        // Actually, looking at the code, processInlineMarkdown gets the same getAttr
        // function and uses it for strong, em, del, code tags in table cells.
        // But those all have styles defined too.
        
        // The only way to trigger line 63 would be if we could:
        // 1. Call getAttr with a tag that has no style defined
        // 2. With an additionalStyle parameter
        
        // Since getAttr is created inside quikdown and only exposed through
        // specific call sites, we can't directly trigger this case.
