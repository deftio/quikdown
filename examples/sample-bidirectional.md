# Bidirectional Editing Test

## Try Editing Either Side!

With **bidirectional mode** enabled, you can:
- Edit this text in the *markdown* panel (left)
- Edit directly in the *rendered* panel (right)
- Changes sync automatically between both!

### Task List (Click checkboxes!)

- [ ] Click these checkboxes in the preview
- [ ] Watch them update in markdown
- [ ] Edit the text directly
- [ ] It all stays in sync!

### Table (Edit cells directly!)

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Edit here | ✅ | Click to edit |
| Or here | ⭐ | Works great! |

> **Tip:** Try editing this blockquote directly in the preview panel!
